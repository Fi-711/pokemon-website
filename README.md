http://pokemon-cards-shop.apps.cs.cf.ac.uk/

## Installation - Windows

**You will need to know the environment variables - stored in a .flaskenv file, not on gitlab. One should be in the submission pack for Learning Central**

Modify package.json so proxy points to your server e.g. for local host it would be: 127.0.0.1:5000 for a flask server

Create a python 3.6 virtual environment in the root with the following command:

`py -3.6 -m venv venv`

Activate the virtual environment:

`venv\Scripts\activate`

Install python dependencies

`pip install -r requirements.txt`

Install node modules with npm

`npm install`

Run flask server

`flask run`

Run react

`npm start`

Website should be available on 127.0.0.1:3000

## Modules Used

### Flask

- **Flask**: Back end server
- **Flask-Mail**: Send email confirmations to users
- **gunicorn**: To deploy project on openshift
- **python-dotenv**: To load environment variables from a file
- **SQLAlchemy**: ORM module to communicate with MySQL db
- **flask-praetorian**: Authorisation using JW tokens. Code modified from provided example docs: https://flask-praetorian.readthedocs.io/en/latest/quickstart.html#example
- **flask-marhsmallow**: Jsonifies data from SQLAlchemy tables using 'schemas'.
- **simplejson**: Flask built in json does not read decimals
- **pokemontcgsdk**: Queries the pokemontcg api (https://pokemontcg.io/) and pulls back data to be pushed to my db. This script is not necessary for deployment but included to show work done.
- **stripe**: To allow backend payment processing

### React

- **react-redux**: manage state in a central store.
- **react-router-dom**: manage front end routes
- **axios**: all fetch requests done through axios - safer, faster, jsonifies data and easy to add parameters/ headers.
- **stripe and stripe-elements**: required to integrate stripe payments.
- **redux-logger**: middleware to debug redux when in development mode
- **redux-persist**: stores redux data in local storage
- **redux-thunk**: helps handle asynchronous requests
- **chakra-ui/react**: styling ui framework mainly used for grids and mobile responsiveness
- **chakra-ui/themes**: extend default chakra theme for bespoke finish
- **material-ui**: rating system - initially used material ui but replaced everything with Chakra UI except this rating panel
- **react-icons**: extra ui icons e.g. delete and edit icons
- **reselect**: helps deconstruct methods when using redux
- **uuid**: generates unique id's - needed for some prop keys
- **node-sass**: helps implement sass css files into react components
- **react-pdf**: generate pdf shipping labels

## Extra Features in MarkScheme

- **Search Function**: On card each card set, next to sort function, can search by name with instant feedback. Throttled response time by 300ms for improved performance.
- **Personalized Greetings**: Names in header on log in and user account page
- **Reviews**: Logged in users can leave reviews on products
- **User Account Page**: Logged in users can review their reviews, receipts and wishlists
- **Admin Account Page: Invoices**: Logged in admins can get invoices of all customers including a search functionality
- **Admin Account Page**: Logged in admins can make pdf shipping labels of purchases
- **Backend Payment Processing**: Using stripe, orders are processes using production ready technology - just need to switch from test to developer server

## Attention to Security

- **Server Side Env Variables**: .env file during development and env variable then manually entered into openshift so passwords and api keys never exposed on gitlab - all env loaded using os.getenv()
- **JWT tokens**: with 60 min life spans and 7 day refresh allowing secure login authorization
- **No session cookies**: so protection against CSRF attacks
- **Stripe Tokens**: rather than standard charges, user details converted to a token and then sent to backend before being processed by Stripe => no storage of sensitive details and data sent encrypted/ secure
- **React**: data is sanitized by functions so no exposed strings for XSS injection attacks
- **Strong Passwords**: Passwords must be at least 8 character, 1 lowercase, 1 uppercase letter and 1 number - checked with regex
- **Client and Server Side Validation**: Password's checked both sides to prevent submissions e.g. with POSTMAN
- **npm audit**: so all packages up to date with 0 known vulnerabilities
- **Validate Email**: protection against fake accounts
- **Logout**: clears local storage of tokens to help protect against XSS attacks
- **Force Logout**: force logout when tokens expire
- **Role Protected Routes**: so only users with correct permissions can access
- **Non-personal user data stored in DB**: not local storage e.g. wishlist, cart details
- **Return Correct Status Codes**: API requests return appropriate status codes e.g. 200, 201, 400, 401 etc and not just json objects

## Attention to Design

- **3828 Cards/ Products**: And easy to add more with the set name added to pokemon_sets.txt file
- **20 SQL tables**: 15 for just the pokemon cards
- **Modern React**: Using hooks rather than class components
- **SPA (Single Page Application)**: fast page renders with no "refresh" screens delivering better user experience than standard server side requests
- **React State** gives real time feedback when filling in forms and searching
- **Chakra-UI**: uses JSS rather than CSS which has the advantages:
  - Incremental compilation and rendering (as soon as needed).
  - Rendered styles are cached => Compilation and DOM Rules creation happens only once.
  - Only styles which are currently in use on your screen are also in the DOM.
  - Simple class selectors ensure high selectors performance at scale.
- **Loaders**: so user aware when data is loading/ being fetched
- **Cart Saved**: not just local session but when user logs out, cart is cleared but when they log back in, it is repopulated as data was stored in a db.
- **Fully Mobile Responsive**: Works on any screen size > 300px.
- **Mobile and Desktop differences**: e.g. collapsing nav bar on mobile, replaced text with icons for space reasons etc
- **SCSS**: more flexible than css - nesting, variables etc - only used for bespoke styles and animations e.g. pokeball loader
- **404 Error Page**: To catch wrong routes e.g. enter by user in browser
- **Dark and Light Mode**: Dark and Light modes for optimal user experience
- **Visual Feedback**: Toasts, shakes and alerts used for visual feedback.
- **Tooltips**: Forms have tooltips to help fill in when hovered over
- **Screen Reader Compliant**: Aria labels, alt text info used for those with special needs
- **Coloured Scrollbars**: separate code needed for firefox and chrome to be cross-platform
- **Cart Closes Clicking Outside Button**: Event listeners used for clicks outside of buttons - gives good user experience as cart now closes by clicking anywhere

## Code Quality

- Code compartmentalized into folders with dot syntax to easily identify them eg .component, .styles etc
- Asynchronous programming using async and await
- Functional programming to use react state
- Python: PEP8 styled code
- React: ES6 javascript syntax conventions e.g. component deconstructing, spread operator etc
- Memoization used to optimize react components
- MySQL database made from 20 separate tables with appropriate foreign key constraints and back_populate references in the ORM db
- Marshmallow Schemas to jsonify data
- Regex used frequently e.g. to pull token from request, password checking etc
